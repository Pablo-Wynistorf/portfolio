Welcome!
My name is Pablo Wynistorf.

I'm an **IT apprentice** at [Swisscom (Schweiz) AG](https://www.swisscom.ch) located in Bern, Switzerland. I am currently in my **third year** as a **Computer Scientist in Plattformengeneering**.

During my free time, I have a variety of hobbies that add value to my life.

First and foremost is my dedication to fitness, involving a consistent gym routine up to five times a week. This not only keeps me physically healthy but also provides a sense of accomplishment.

In addition, I have a keen interest in computer science, and I follow a wide range of **[IT projects](https://github.com/Pablo-Wynistorf?tab=repositories)**. This immersive engagement adds another layer to my multifaceted pursuits, highlighting my passion for technology and innovation.

When I step outside, I immerse myself in the tranquility of nature. Whether skillfully flying my drone to capture beautiful shots or simply taking a peaceful walk, I find comfort and inspiration in the natural world. By the way, every aerial photograph in my portfolio is taken by me.

In my leisure moments, I improve my culinary skills. I take great pleasure in the careful art of cooking and baking, considering it both a creative outlet and a way to relax.

As winter covers the landscape, I swap the weights for skis, enjoying the thrill of gliding down snowy slopes. Conversely, when the summer sun shines, I embrace the warmth by indulging in the timeless joy of swimming in the **[Aare](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/aare/)**, often accompanied by friends.

This carefully curated mix of activities shapes my dynamic and well-rounded lifestyle. Each element contributes to a portfolio that reflects not only professional accomplishments but also a personal commitment to a satisfying life beyond work.




I have participated in the **[SwissSkills competitionships 2023](https://www.ict-berufsbildung.ch/ictskills2023)** in the **Cloud Computing** category and reached the **[second place](https://www.ict-berufsbildung.ch/resources/Results-ICTskills2023.pdf)**. In cause of that, I got invited to a assessment, where the best two participants of each year SwissSkills 2021 and SwissSkills 2022 are competing against each other, in order to find the best matching competitor for the **[WorldSkills 2024 in Lyon](https://worldskills.org/what/competitions/worldskills-lyon-2024)**. I'm very proud and happy to be able to say, that I got selected by the SwissSkills Comitee. That concretely means that I will represent Switzerland in the **[WorldSkills 2024 in Lyon, France](https://worldskills.org/what/competitions/worldskills-lyon-2024)**.
